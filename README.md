 Smart Contract Assignment & Licenses

 NFT & Other Smart Contract Licenses 
 
Many smart contract projects are in the NFT space. This project aims to document smart contract licenses agreements of popular projects. The copyright, if any, to these licenses belong to the copyright holder. Comments, notations, and mark-ups of these documents are intended to spark discussion, debate, and fair commentary by the contract owners, the licenses of the projects, the legal community, and those interested in moving smart contracts and blockchain forward. 

Smart-contract technology typically requires an off-block copyright assignment or license agreement, often included on a project website terms of use or a stand-alone web page (hopefully IPFS). This is true with most NFT sales where the token contract sets forth ownership and royalty terms but leaves the contract terms to the linked digital asset to the asset owner or NFT project.

Many projects, especially early in 2021, didn't include any copyright assignment or license terms as part of the NFT listing (i.e., Crypto Punks). Other projects like Bored APe Yacht CLub include ownership and license limitations which seem internally inconsistent and incoherent. Let's fix this issue by helping the community understand how to sell digital assets associated with NFTs, license copyrighted materials, and create more certainty for sellers and buyers of tokens.
