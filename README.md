#  Linked Digital Asset Contracts

NFT Linked Digital Asset License Project.
 
Many smart contracts are being added to the blockhain as a result of NFT sales.  NFT drops often have weak, unintelligible, or non-existent linked digital asset license agreements. We have started a 'Linked Digital Asset Contract' project for #NFT sales on GitHub. If you are an #ip attorney, NFT project owner or NFT buyer interested in #NFTs and the linked digital assets (i.e. the Bored Ape image), we would love you to join and contribute to this important project as we continue to bring clarity and reduce risk in the NFT market. This 'NFT Linked Digital Asset License Project' aims to document the linked digital asset license agreements of popular NFT projects.  Comments, notations, and mark-ups of the documents uploaded to this project will, hopefully, spark discussion, debate, and fair commentary by the contract owners, the licensees of the projects and the NFT legal community.

Smart-contract technology typically requires an off-block copyright assignment or license agreement, often included on a project website terms of use or a stand-alone web page (hopefully IPFS). This is true with most NFT sales where the token contract sets forth ownership and royalty terms but leaves the contract terms to the linked digital asset to the asset owner or NFT project.

Many projects, especially early in 2021, didn't include any copyright assignment or license terms for the linked digital asset in the NFT listing (i.e., the Crypto Punks project). Other projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club include ownership and license limitations which seem internally inconsistent and incoherent. Let's fix this issue by helping the community understand how to assign and license copyrighted digital assets linked to NFT sales and create more certainty reagrding the rights and limitations in the linked digital asset for sellers and buyers of tokens. 

Non-Fungible Token:  The token contract stored on the blockchain governs the token's ownership, transfer, and royalties and links to the associated digital asset.

Linked Digital Asset:  The digital file uploaded to an off-block or decentralized server. This file is typically an image, video, animated GIF, or sound file. Often, the linked digital asset is subject to copyright. 

Linked Digital Asset Contract: This is the contract between an NFT buyer and seller that sets forth the terms for the linked digital asset. Suppose the linked digital asset is subject to copyright. In that case, the linked digital asset contract can either assign all rights (ownership) to the token owner or a copyright license of the linked digital asset to the token owner. The copyright license can grant exclusive or non-exclusive rights to use, copying, distribution, creation of derivative works. The copyright will typically include restrictions that might limit personal or commercial use of the linked digital asset.
