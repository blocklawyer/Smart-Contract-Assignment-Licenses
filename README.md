# Smart Contract Assignment & Licenses

NFT Linked Digital Asset License Project.
 
Many smart contract projects are in the NFT space. This project aims to document smart contract licenses agreements of popular projects. The copyright, if any, to these licenses belong to the copyright holder. Comments, notations, and mark-ups of these documents will spark discussion, debate, and fair commentary by the contract owners, the licenses of the projects, the legal community, and those interested in moving smart contracts and blockchain forward. 

Smart-contract technology typically requires an off-block copyright assignment or license agreement, often included on a project website terms of use or a stand-alone web page (hopefully IPFS). This is true with most NFT sales where the token contract sets forth ownership and royalty terms but leaves the contract terms to the linked digital asset to the asset owner or NFT project.

Many projects, especially early in 2021, didn't include any copyright assignment or license terms in the NFT listing (i.e., Crypto Punks). Other projects like Bored APe Yacht CLub include ownership and license limitations which seem internally inconsistent and incoherent. Let's fix this issue by helping the community understand how to sell digital assets associated with NFTs, license copyrighted materials, and create more certainty for sellers and buyers of tokens. 

Non-Fungible Token:  The token contract stored on the blockchain governs the token's ownership, transfer, and royalties and links to the associated digital asset.

Linked Digital Asset:  The digital file uploaded to an off-block or decentralized server. This file is typically an image, video, animated GIF, or sound file. Often, the linked digital asset is subject to copyright. 

Linked Digital Asset: This is the contract between an NFT buyer and seller that sets forth the terms for the linked digital asset. Suppose the linked digital asset is subject to copyright. In that case, the linked digital asset contract can either assign all rights (ownership) to the token owner or a copyright license of the linked digital asset to the token owner. The copyright license can grant exclusive or non-exclusive rights to use, copying, distribution, creation of derivative works. The copyright will typically include restrictions that might limit personal or commercial use of the linked digital asset.
